/**
 * Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted directed graph
 * using Dijkstraâ€™s
 *
 * Uses [PriorityQueue] to always look at each vertex
 * with the currently known "lowest" distance from [start]
 *
 * @param VertexType represents each vertex in the graph
 * @param graph contains vertices and weighted edges
 * @param start the starting vertex
 * @param destination the target vertex whose shortest path is to be found
 * @return a [List] of vertices representing the shortest path
 *
 * from start to finish, this includes both endpoints
 * returns `null` if no path exists
 *
 * Notes:
 * ->All edge weights must be non-negative
 * -> If [start] equals [destination], the result is a single-element list `[start]`
 * -> The path is rebuilt by tracing backward from [destination]
