# Benchmarks
Benchmarked original matrix multiplication and Strassen’s algorithm for square matrices of sizes 32, 64, 128, and 256.
For each size, Strassen was looked at with several cutoff thresholds determining when to switch to standard multiplication.
My results showed that Strassen’s algorithm begins to outperform the conventional method for sizes above 64,
especially when the cutoff is around 64 to 128.
For smaller matrices, recursive overhead dominates, causing Strassen to underperform.
A hybrid implementation that uses the original multiplication below n ≈ 64 achieves the best overall efficiency.
